A lightweight ecomm web store, created using NextJS, using Sanity as a backend, and with full Stripe integration.

For full store functionality, you'll need your own Sanity backend and Stripe account.

You'll need ENV variables for sanity:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_TOKEN
```
and Stripe:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
```

## To get Started

```
npm install

npm run dev
```
